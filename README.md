# PILCO

This reposistory was used to generate code for the final project for the course CS5180 Reinforcement Learning at Northeastern University, Boston. 

## Dependencies 
* Numpy
* Matlplotlib
*	Cvxpy
* Pytorch
* Gpytorch
* Gym 

## Objective 
Generate a time optimal speed profile for any non-linear dynamics resulting in a non-linear controller without any expert knowledge. This control policy is time optimal in generating inputs that produce rest-to-rest motion. 

## The code

All the code is in main.ipynb
